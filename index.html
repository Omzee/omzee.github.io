          <p>Hi I'm Omzee this is my website. I'm a student and I like playing games. I guess for now this website
            is gonna be filled with my DnD characters. The social media links just link to the blog for now, that's
            intentional. Here's some filler text about symbols I like:<br>
            ----------------------------------<br>
            The Ouroboros or uroborus (/ˌ(j)ʊərəˈbɒrəs, uːˈrɒbərɒs/) is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon
            eating its own tail. Originating in ancient Egyptian iconography, the ouroboros entered western tradition
            via Greek magical tradition and was adopted as a symbol in Gnosticism and Hermeticism and most notably in
            alchemy. The term derives from Ancient Greek: οὐροβόρος, from οὐρά (oura), "tail" + βορά (bora), "food",
            from βιβρώσκω (bibrōskō), "I eat". <br>
            ----------------------------------<br>
            Sulfur (“Leviathan Cross”) A symbol for the alchemical element Sulfur, (Brimstone) which is spiritually
            analogous to the human soul. Alchemically, sulfur has the qualities of masculine, hot and dry. Combined
            with Mercury (feminine, cool and moist), the pair were considered the parents of all metals.

            Alchemical drawings often portray Sulfur as the sun. (In some views, sulfur and salt are the parents of
            Mercury) The symbol of sulfur is often used as an identifying symbol by Satanists, due to sulfur’s
            historical asociation with the devil. <br>
            <!-- ----------------------------------<br>
            The Ankh is an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol that was most commonly used in writing and in art to
            represent the word for "life" and, by extension, as a symbol of life itself. The sign has a cross shape but
            with an oval loop in place of an upper bar. The origins of the symbol are not known, although many
            hypotheses have been proposed. It was used in writing as a triliteral sign, representing a sequence of
            three consonants, Ꜥ-n-ḫ. -->
